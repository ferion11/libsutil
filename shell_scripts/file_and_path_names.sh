# I haven't tested it extensively but I could get the extension with ext="${filename##?(.)+([^.])?(.)}" and the name without extension then with raw_name="${filename:0:${#filename} - ${#ext}}" like this you at least won't need the conditional afterwards. It at least works for files without extension, multiple extensions like tar.gz and also files starting with a dot. â€“ satanik Aug 15 '19 at 20:04
